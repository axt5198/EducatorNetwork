Welcome to Prendi!

Prendi is an Educator Network where educators and subject matter experts can upload their digital courses. Interested learners can purchase the course directly from instructors in a decentralized fashion using the Ethereum network.


Our platform will allow educators to upload their digital courses and get rewarded by interested learners without Prendiâ€™s involvement. Instead, users who wish to learn the course will purchase the content and a user-to-user transaction for the price of the course will be executed.
